### Welcome!

# Hi there, I'm Luana Cristini! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Tester Engineer from Brazil with a passion for discovering new tools and technologies. This README is here to provide some information about who I am, what I do and how to get in touch with me.

## What I'm up to

:computer: I'm currently working as a Software Tester Engineer <br>
:books: I'm learning about DevOps, Frontend and Backend <br>
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to software testing or my tech learning journey! <br>

When I'm not coding or studying, I like to spend quality time with my furry family members. I have two lovable dogs and three adorable cats who always manage to put a smile on my face! In my free time, you can also find me listening to music or playing video games.
